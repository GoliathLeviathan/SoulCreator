# Overview

This program generates the necessary python files out of `.ui`- and `.qrc`-files generated by Qt-Designer. It is able to work with either PySide or PyQt4.


## Requirements

ResourcesPythonQt requires Python Version 3.2 or greater. Either `pyside-uic` and `pyside-rcc` or `pyuic4` and `pyrcc4` have to be installed


### Linux


#### Debian/Ubuntu

To get the PySide tools just type the following line as root:

	apt-get install pyside-tools

For the PyQt4 tools you can type this:

	apt-get install pyqt-tools


### Windows

At the moment, this program is not configured to work with Windows.

The reason is mainly, that the command line tools are not as easy accessable under Windows as they are under Linux.


## Execution

To execute the Program just start `resourcesPythonQt.py` in a Python3 environment:

	python3 resourcesPythonQt.py <path1> [<path2> ...]

Alternatively you can set the executable flag for `resourcesPythonQt.py` and start it directly:

	chmod +x resourcesPythonQt.py
	./resourcesPythonQt.py <path1> [<path2> ...]
