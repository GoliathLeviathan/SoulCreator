## Usage

After the start of SoulCreator, the user can input information of his new character, choose a name and allocate points on Attributes, Skills, Merits, Powers etc. Each species (Humans, Changelings, Mages, Vampires and Werewolves) will provide the user with different traits and powers and a different design of character sheet.

At the moment, SoulCreator does not prohibit the user from freely distributing as many points as he wants. A system to keep count on the experience points, such a character would cost, is not implemented yet.
